## Introduction to Operating System (OS)

An Operating System (OS) is a software that manages both hardware and software resources of a computer.
It is often called a “Resource Manager” or a “Virtual Machine” because it acts as a bridge between hardware and software components.

The OS is responsible for virtualization, meaning it creates a virtual environment where applications can run smoothly without directly interacting with the hardware. It helps run programs, allocate memory, and manage multiple tasks simultaneously by creating a virtual CPU for each process.

In modern computers, the OS plays a crucial role in making complex operations easier.
Before operating systems existed, users had to control hardware and software manually using machine code (for example: 0101), which was very difficult and time-consuming.

With the introduction of operating systems, these low-level operations are handled automatically.
We simply perform actions or give commands, and the OS translates them into machine code.

## Key Functions of an Operating System

 - Resource Management – Manages CPU, memory, and I/O devices efficiently.

 - Memory Allocation – Assigns and tracks memory usage for different programs.

 - Virtualization – Provides virtual memory and virtual CPUs for processes.

 - Concurrency – Allows multiple programs to run simultaneously.

 - User Interface – Offers an environment for users to interact with the system easily.
